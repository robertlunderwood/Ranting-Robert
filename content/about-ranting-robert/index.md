So you've found my blog.  I guess it would be prudent to tell you a little about the purpose of my little corner of the internet.

To be clear, I am a Christian and I am a conservative.  Most of what I post is viewed from that lens along with life experience and data.  As a result, there may be an inherent bias to what I post.  Unlike most of the media that pretends they are neutral when they are really far left, I am stating openly where I come from.  

While there are a lot of political posts here, not everything here is about politics.  There are plenty of posts about local news items, sports, and even some poetry from time to time.  So consider this a bit of a hodgepodge.  I'm always open to new ideas to rant about.  For example, I want to talk more about the world using data analytics.  There's a reason the content of this site was moved to R Markdown.

Unlike most social media sites and other platforms, I'm a believer of free speech and civil debate.  As such, I am free to discuss the issues I want to discuss in the way I want to discuss them without facing a ban or being shamed by our internet overlords.  The great thing about this is that it's reciprocal meaning you are just as free to state your opinions and I welcome it.  The only bounds that I have are that we should be civil to each other and that all commentary should be kept at a PG-13 level.
