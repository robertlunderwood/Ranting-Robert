So I am back to blogging.  No Blogger this time.  As much as I loved the ease and convenience, I needed my own website with my own flexibility.  With that being said, this platform requires me to be a bit more engaged to writing and posting on social media.  My first new post should be up soon.  If there is anything you want me to discuss in particular, please feel free to comment below.  I can also be reached on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/robertlunderwood), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/robunderwood), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+robertunderwood).

Until then, I leave you with this quote:
