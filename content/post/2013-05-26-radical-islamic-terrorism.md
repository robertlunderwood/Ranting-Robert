This past week, a British solider was hacked to death by two terrorists.  For more information, (VIEWERS DISCRETION ADVISED!) please [check it out](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10073910/Woolwich-attack-terrorist-proclaimed-an-eye-for-an-eye-after-attack.html).  This solider was hacked and stabbed to death.  The two guys were shouting “Allahu Akbar!” in the process.  Afterwards, these two men were allowed to walk around for at least 20 minutes before police showed up to the scene.  During that time period, one of the men walked up to a camera and clearly explained his [reasoning](https://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/22/police-investigating-possible-terror-attack-in-london/):

> “We swear by Almighty Allah, we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone. The only reasons we killed this man is because Muslims are dying daily. This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” the man with bloodied hands [told a cameraperson](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/bloodied-london-attacker-speaks-to-camera-after-beheading-you-people-will-never-be-safe/), as the victim’s body lay nearby. ” I apologize that women had to witness this today, but in our land, our women have to see the same! You people will never be safe. Remove your government, they don’t care about you!”

Credit to U.K. officials for immediately calling this a terrorist attack by Islamic extremists.  It’s should be obvious to most sane people.

Good luck getting our news networks to [admit the same](https://newsbusters.org/blogs/matthew-philbin/2013/05/23/networks-evening-shows-don-t-name-islam-london-terror-attack).  Or [Barack Obama](https://blog.heritage.org/2013/05/24/now-president-obama-refuses-to-label-london-terror-attack-terrorism/).  Or the State Department:

> The United States condemns today’s attack in the Woolwich district of London. We stand with our U.K. allies in the face of such senseless violence. Our thoughts and condolence are with the family of the victim and the British people.

Really?  ”Senseless violence”?  This isn’t exactly the first time the President or his administration has avoided calling something a terrorist attack.

1.  The events of Benghazi was initialed called a protest incited by a Youtube video.  For at least TWO WEEKS, the administration refused to call it a terrorist attack.  U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice went of five Sunday talk shows blaming the video and insisting it wasn’t a premeditated attack.  This despite clear evidence and reports coming out of Libya stating it was a pre-planned attack.
2.  The Fort Hood shooting in 2009 which left 13 dead and 32 wounded was called “[workplace violence](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/12/06/military-growing-terrorist-target-lawmakers-warn/)“.  This is despite the shooter’s ties to Anwar al-Awlaki.  And despite the shooter shouting “Allahu Akbar!”  As a result, he is being court martialed instead of being treated as an enemy combatant.  He has been [paid $278,000 while awaiting trial](https://www.nbcdfw.com/investigations/Accused-Fort-Hood-Shooter-Paid-278000-While-Awaiting-Trial-208230691.html).  This “workplace violence” designation has denied those killed and injured the benefits and pay one would receive for combat pay.

Does Barack Obama recognize the threat that Islamic Jihad presents throughout the world?  Or does he just want it to go away?  If this London attack would have happened here, would Obama have called it a terrorist attack?  I have my doubts.

The sad part about this that the Quran endorses this kind of attacks against “infidels”.  Just to get a glimspe of the damage Islam causes, check out [The Religion of Peace](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/).

Maybe it’s time for this country to get serious about who we let into this country.  Those Boston bombers were part of a terrorist cell and I highly, highly doubt that is the [only one](https://www.investigativeproject.org/maps.php).  We are under the constant threat of radical Islam and our president doesn’t have the balls to call it what it is.  Then again, this is the same president who keeps giving [fighter jets to the Muslim Brotherhood](https://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/04/12/US-Sends-4-More-F-16-Jets-to-Egypt).
