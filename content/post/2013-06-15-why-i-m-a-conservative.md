So some of my friends have criticized me for being a conservative.  They go on to site how much damage and suffering African-Americans have gone through because of conservatives or how conservatives are made up of rich, racist, old white men.  Or they complain about conservatives clinging to their guns and Bibles and having “outdated” morals and traditions.

Nothing can be further from the truth.

I’m a conservative because I am against big government.  Because I am against reckless spending.  Because I am against the government interfering in every facet of our lives.  Because I am against the government taking my money that I earned.  Because I am against the government serving special interest groups.  Because I am against the government telling me what kind of health care I should get.  Because I am against lawmakers passing bills without reading them first.  Because I am against shady, back door deals.

I’m a conservative because I stand for the Constitution.  Because I believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Because I believe in freedom OF religion (not freedom FROM religion).  Because I believe in freedom of speech and of the press.  Because I believe in holding our government accountable for everything they do.  Because I believe in the right to bear arms, not for hunting but to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government.  Because I believe in the right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure.  Because I believe in free enterprise.  Because I believe in personal responsibility and accountability.  Because I believe marriage is between one man and one woman.

Most importantly, I am a conservative because I believe in morality and straying from God and the Constitution is killing us.

And that Obama is the biggest mistake America has ever made.
