> [Safe Space](https://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/607-glossary): A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect and dignity and strongly encourage everyone to respect others

**WHAT??!!!!**

Where did this come from and why are these popping up all over college campuses in America?  Seriously, how did this happen?  Aren't college students supposed to be mature?  Aren't college students supposed to be able to think critically?  Aren't colleges supposed to challenge their students and make them form a coherent and knowledgeable argument?  Aren't these challenges supposed to make students feel uncomfortable and exposed?

These "safe spaces" were originally meant for the LGBT community where they could feel safe to express their sexuality without facing "judgement" from their peers.  The "safe spaces" are being used to rally like-minded people who don't want to be exposed to different opinions or to actual facts.  However it seems as though entire college campus are being made into "safe spaces" where [speeches are being cancelled](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/20/williams-college-dropped-me-from-its-uncomfortable-learning-speaker-series-why.html) due to uncomfortable subject matter and political correctness.

With the heightened racial tensions in America, blacks have been creating their own ["spaces"](https://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/11/11/mizzou-demonstrators-segregate-white-allies-to-form-black-only-healing-space/) to vent and heal from the "oppression" that they face.  What's really happening is that these are being used to rally the troops to fight against "the man" and "the system" which is "keeping the black man down".  Naturally, these "spaces" are being used to keep those with dissenting views, like mine, out.  In addition, some of these "black spaces" are being used to keep white people out.

Isn't that by definition racism?

> [Racial Discrimination](https://www.hri.org/docs/ICERD66.html): Any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

Notice how it doesn't mention which race could be subject to or is the cause of discrimination.  In other words, blacks can be racists too.  What happens when you try to mention that to black people?  This:

In every space, both in person and online, this is the general result. Black people don't want to be exposed to "radical" ideas or to dissenting opinions.  They don't want to get into a knowledgeable debate for fearing being proven wrong or exposed.  Just like feminists.  Just like the LGBT community.  Instead of colleges and universities being the point where people of different backgrounds and experiences come together to challenge views and make each other well-rounded for the sake of gaining and creating knowledge together, they are being used indoctrinate students to one singular world view, a view which excludes conservatives, white men, and Christians.

These students think they have the right to not be offended.  Unfortunately, the first amendment gives all of us the right to offend.  The only way to learn and grow is to be offended and to react accordingly; it's something I like to call constructive criticism.  However, we have to be able to call a spade a spade.  Political correctness will doom us all.

I just wish blacks would listen.
