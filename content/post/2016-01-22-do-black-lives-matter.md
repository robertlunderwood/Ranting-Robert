I don't watch shows like *Family Guy, The Simpsons, South Park*, etc.  They're usually full of trash and (mostly) liberal propaganda.  However, even a blind squirrel can find a nut every once in a while.  A clip from an episode of *Family Guy* went viral last month.

> Peter Griffin: Everyone! Everyone! Listen, I have something to say. Cleveland Jr. Doesn't deserve any of this. All those things you heard about Cleveland Jr. were lies. He didn't do anything to me. He's a good kid, from a good family. I just got scared, and I did something stupid. I swear, it had nothing to do with the color of his skin, but I did shoot him. I deserve to be held responsible for my actions. Even if that means going to jail.

> Swanson: You heard him, other cops. Let's take him in.

> Officer 1: He doesn't know our names, does he?

> Officer 2: I don't think he does.

> Brown: Wait a minute. Peter didn't shoot my son. I did. Peter was just taking the blame for me. He's a good friend.

> Takanawa: Eh, Mr. Brown, what exactly are you saying?

> Brown: I'm saying that I, Cleveland Brown, a black man, shot Cleveland Brown, Jr., another black man.

> Peter Griffin: Wait, wh-where did everybody go?

> Brown: You want to make the media go away? Just mention black-on-black crime.

> Brian Griffin: Boy, the world we live in, huh?

The writers nailed it this time.  Every time a police officer or a white person injures or kills a black person, national media jumps all over it.  There are rants on social media, speeches by civil rights leaders, and ~~protests~~ riots in the streets.  But only about 1% of black murders are by police and 10% of black murders are by non-blacks.  For the last six years, at least 90% of black murders were committed by...BLACK PEOPLE!

These murders are just a blip on the radar for the media.  For most blacks, these murders are mostly fathers, sons, uncles, cousins, and nephews being killed.  That's right, there is a wholesale of black murders daily, most of which goes ignored.  Only a few are reported by local media.  The only ones that go national involve a child being killed.  But how many of these names do we remember after a week?

The #BlackLivesMatter movement is so concerned about what police and non-blacks do to black people, yet they are as guilty as the media for ignoring the war zones the streets have become.  Those streets are so dangerous that kids can't play outside, people feel unsafe outside and inside their own homes, and businesses are afraid to open; whatever businesses that did exist are now closed..  The only way some of these neighborhoods have gotten better has been the result of gentrification, but then black people can't afford to live in those neighborhoods anymore.  Any neighborhood that hasn't been gentrified is exactly the same as it was 15-20 years ago, if not worse.

Do you want to know why things haven't gotten better?  It's because people are committing the same mistakes.  I've covered this many times here, here, here, and here.  You can polish a turd all you want; it's still a turd.  If you remodel the outside of the house, but the foundation is still messed up, the house is still going to crumble.  In other words, if you clean up the exterior of the community, but you keep harboring the same crap that messed it up in the first, it's only going to get messed up all over again.

Don't allow drug dealers, gang members, criminals, and murders into your neighborhoods.  Report these people to the police and have them locked up.  If you see something, say something.  Start snitchin'!  Stop glorifying the lifestyle.  A wound cannot heal until the object which caused the wound is removed.  If you wait too long, the wound will become infected and may kill you.

If black lives really matter, then we should protect black lives from the biggest thing that threatens them:  other black lives!  You want other people to care about you and help you?  Starting caring about and helping each other first.
