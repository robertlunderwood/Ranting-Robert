Let me see if I got this right. If I were to ever stand with #BlackLivesMatter, I would get a ton of likes. When I post #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter, I have condemnation in a conversation thread a mile long. Talking about #PokemonGo would get me a ton of likes.
 
Yet talking about Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI gets silence. Talking about Radical Islamic terrorism -- the biggest issue of our time -- gets silence. The terrorist attack in Nice, France is at least the third major terrorist attack in France in the last year and a half. And that's not including other attacks throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa, most of which go unmentioned in our media but kill scores of people daily. Or the three that took place on U.S. soil in the last year.  There are more lone wolf attacks from Muslims within our borders than ever before.
 
Given this backdrop and the damage being done by Syrian refugees in Europe (robberies, murders, rapes, etc), Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to increase the number of Syrian refugees, very few of whom have papers.  Lest we forget that there were Syrian refugees involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks.  And they have the nerve to call Donald Trump crazy for closing our doors to Muslims until the situation is under control.
 
Who's the crazy one now?
 
While America spends its time waging a war between black lives and police lives or obsessed over Pok√©mon again, radical followers of a religion founded by a sadistic, plundering, sexist, racist, raping pedophile are looking to kill us all.  They kill straight people, gay people, bisexual people, transgender people, white people, black people, brown people, men, women, children, Atheists, Agnostics, Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons, Scientologist, and other Muslims.  Don't let the media deceive you; bombings and shootings are an everyday occurrence in some countries.
 
Prayers are encouraged, but it's time for action.  It's time for real leaders to step up and do what needs to be done to protect the free world.  The last thing we need right now is political correctness.  That has gotten us nowhere in the last eight years.  If we don't get a handle on radical Islamic terrorism, then #BlackLivesMatter, #BlueLivesMatter, #PokemonGo, #LoveisLove, or #AllLivesMatter will be the least of our problems.
 
Wake up!  Or there won't be any lives to matter.
