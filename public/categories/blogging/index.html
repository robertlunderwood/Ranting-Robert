  <p class="post-summary">I thought “Hope and Change” was the name of the game in 2008. So why are you so resistant and allergic to change now? Is it because you don’t want the changes? Maybe you don’t like the changes. Was this not what you wanted?
The reality is that the United States federal government is both broke and broken. Yet anytime President Donald Trump (Still hurts, doesn’t it?) proposes some kind of change to try to get our house in order, the Democrats in Congress, most leftists, and most of the mainstream media poo-poo all over it.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">When Roger Goodell succeeded Paul Tagliabue as NFL commissioner in 2006, players getting into trouble off the field was become a major problem. With players like Adam “Pacman” Jones and Chris Henry getting arrested every other week and a multitude of other players committing various legal infractions going unpunished by the league, it appeared as though a firm hand was needed. Long-term suspensions for Jones and Henry in 2007 seemed to send a message that improper behavior was no longer tolerated.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Let me see if I got this right. If I were to ever stand with #BlackLivesMatter, I would get a ton of likes. When I post #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter, I have condemnation in a conversation thread a mile long. Talking about #PokemonGo would get me a ton of likes.
Yet talking about Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI gets silence. Talking about Radical Islamic terrorism – the biggest issue of our time – gets silence.</p>

 Most of you should recognize that as the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A lot of power and responsibility is recognized in that sentence.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Really? This #NeverTrump movement by fellow conservatives is getting out of hand. Do you realize at this point is that your only real options are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton?
Look, I get it. I’m not a Trump guy myself. My first choice was Ben Carson, my second choice was Ted Cruz. They were a couple of solid conservatives who would have brought reason, common sense, and strong morals back to the White House.</p>

I am not responsible for any hurt feelings this may cause. Of course, I don’t care about your feelings.
Pittsburgh reporter Wendy Bell was fired from WTAE after making some controversial remarks on her Facebook page after a recent shooting. As we all know, when we talk about controversy and black people, it usually means black people don’t like what someone else said about them because it’s the truth.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Once upon a time, there was a wide receiver who was very talented physically but had some issues of the field. He liked to smoke marijuana in his free time. An NFL team decided to take a chance on him and he was able to put up big numbers on the field as a rookie. However, he was suspended for a few games before his second year in the league. The troubled wide receiver promised to clean up his act and returned to dominating on the field after returning for suspension.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">For those of you that have been living under a rock, the FBI and Apple have been engaged in a legal battle over unlocking the iPhone of the terrorist in the San Bernadino attack. The FBI wants to get into the phone to further investigate the attack, having already previously obtained a warrant. However, they cannot get into the phone since there is a pass code. It’s a newer model phone with built-in encryption and investigators are worried the data would be wiped if they tried to get access to the phone by brute force–10,000 combinations and the phone will probably wipe itself after 10 tries.</p>

Bernie Sanders is an admitted “democratic socialist”. There used to be a time not that long ago where socialism was proven to be a very bad thing in America and one step away from communism.</p>
