  <p class="post-summary">Over two years ago, I wrote a post after an attack in London in regards to radical Islam. I called out President Obama for not calling out radical Islam. He refuses to use those words. In fact, he referred to ISIS as a JV team in 2014. Even after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015, President Obama refused to acknowledge that the real problem isn’t the people, but the religion.</p>

 WHAT??!!!!
Where did this come from and why are these popping up all over college campuses in America?</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Maury, Steve Wilkos, Jeremy Kyle, Trisha, Paternity Court… The list goes on. A lot of hours per day on daytime TV is spent dealing with paternity tests. Thousands of children who don’t know who their father is. Thousands of women testing thousands of men so they can find their “baby’s daddy”. Thousands of men who don’t want to deal with “baby mama drama”. Even if the episode isn’t about paternity, there are at least two “adults” involved in issues that break up relationships (if it isn’t already broken) where these adults happen to have children involved.</p>

 That’s a mouthful right there. I’m not going to go into detail as to what all of this means.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I didn’t think I would need to write this post. This subject was exhausted over the summer and wouldn’t be a relevant subject again unless the unthinkable happens…
NOOOO!!!!
It’s Mike Vick time in Pittsburgh.
So everybody has their concerns for one of two reasons. Either they don’t think he can play anymore if he ever could play, or they harp on his past with dogfighting. If someone is worried about the Steelers and Michael Vick for football-related reasons (can’t throw accurately, turns the ball over, always injured, too old, etc.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So a couple days ago when I was about to make a post when I found that my website was compromised by Iranian hackers. My content was still there but you had to scroll halfway down the page through some obscene material. If anyone saw that, I greatly apologize. It seems as though I was hacked for a couple of weeks before I noticed. That’s what happens when you don’t keep up with stuff…</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I thought we were over this. I thought we learned our lesson and moved on. I thought there were more important things going on in the world that required our time attention.
I thought wrong.
Out of all of the lessons and actions that could have possibly been taken after the Charleston church shooting, Americans choose to turn their anger, not towards the person (the conservative response) or towards guns (the liberal response), but towards a flag.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">For some of you who used to follow my old rambling and rants that I posted on Myspace (yeah, I know) and Facebook from the late 2000s, you may remember how often I went off on black people. I made a promise to never again use my forum to discuss issues about the black community. It’s not that I wanted to avoid confrontation. I just got sick and tired of writing about the same old thing over and over and over and over and over and over again.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Yep. I’m making the leap. I’ve thought about doing it for about three years now. I’ve spent plenty of time praying about it and exploring the options available to me. However, I’m not going to get anywhere by thinking about it. I’m at a standstill while everything is passing me by. It’ll be tough, but if God wants it to be, it’ll be.
After all, if God gave someone a gift, an ability, or a tool that very few people had and he didn’t use it, wouldn’t he be disappointing God?</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So a select committee has finally been formed to investigate Benghazi…20 months and one Presidential election after the attack. There are STILL questions that we are still awaiting honest answers for. I think the family members of the victims deserve answers more. In no particular order:
Why did we still have people in Benghazi after every other foreign entity, including the Red Cross, left due to safety concerns?
Why was security not increased after previous attacks on the consulate in April 2012 and on the International Red Cross office in May 2012?</p>
