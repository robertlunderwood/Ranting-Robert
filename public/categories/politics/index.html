  <p class="post-summary">I thought “Hope and Change” was the name of the game in 2008. So why are you so resistant and allergic to change now? Is it because you don’t want the changes? Maybe you don’t like the changes. Was this not what you wanted?
The reality is that the United States federal government is both broke and broken. Yet anytime President Donald Trump (Still hurts, doesn’t it?) proposes some kind of change to try to get our house in order, the Democrats in Congress, most leftists, and most of the mainstream media poo-poo all over it.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Let me see if I got this right. If I were to ever stand with #BlackLivesMatter, I would get a ton of likes. When I post #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter, I have condemnation in a conversation thread a mile long. Talking about #PokemonGo would get me a ton of likes.
Yet talking about Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI gets silence. Talking about Radical Islamic terrorism – the biggest issue of our time – gets silence.</p>

 Most of you should recognize that as the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A lot of power and responsibility is recognized in that sentence.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Really? This #NeverTrump movement by fellow conservatives is getting out of hand. Do you realize at this point is that your only real options are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton?
Look, I get it. I’m not a Trump guy myself. My first choice was Ben Carson, my second choice was Ted Cruz. They were a couple of solid conservatives who would have brought reason, common sense, and strong morals back to the White House.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Over the last 10-20 years, I have had many heated political discussions with people of different colors, different backgrounds, and different walks of life. Social media has made it easier to have these discussions and meet all kinds of people. When having such discussions, my goal is to be as clear minded and rational as possible when arguing my point of view while trying to use as much anecdotal evidence as possible.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Republican Presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is proposing a 14.9% flat income tax and throwing out the current tax code. The primary arguments made for going to a flat tax is simple: there will be no loopholes for anyone to jump through and take advantage of, no one will be taxed twice on capital gains, interest and dividends, and most citizens will have some skin in the game.</p>

1. The Size of Government  The best place to start is with this one. What is the role of government in our lives? I think the U.S. federal government has only a few rights and responsibilities.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So a few days ago, the “Every Student Succeeds Act” was signed into law after passing the House and Senate with broad bipartisan support, a rarity in recent times. This law does away with most of the regulations that were put into place with “No Child Left Behind” and returns a lot of the power in regards to education policy back to the states. As a result, the strict pressures in testing students to receive federal funding is removed.</p>

    <p class="post-meta">@Robert Underwood · Dec 4, 2015 · 8 min read</p>
  </header>
  
  <p class="post-summary">Barack Obama won over 90% of the black vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In addition, Democrats routinely win at least 80% of the black vote in every election on every level. Yet black people have struggled for generations to get ahead while every other group has. This leads to an obvious question:
Why don’t blacks vote conservative?
Or perhaps the real question is why do blacks not consider any republican, independent, or any third party but vote for Democrats in droves?</p>
