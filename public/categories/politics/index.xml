      <title>Resistant to Change</title>

      <description>I thought &amp;ldquo;Hope and Change&amp;rdquo; was the name of the game in 2008. So why are you so resistant and allergic to change now? Is it because you don&#39;t want the changes? Maybe you don&#39;t like the changes. Was this not what you wanted?
The reality is that the United States federal government is both broke and broken. Yet anytime President Donald Trump (Still hurts, doesn&#39;t it?) proposes some kind of change to try to get our house in order, the Democrats in Congress, most leftists, and most of the mainstream media poo-poo all over it.</description>

      <description>Let me see if I got this right. If I were to ever stand with #BlackLivesMatter, I would get a ton of likes. When I post #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter, I have condemnation in a conversation thread a mile long. Talking about #PokemonGo would get me a ton of likes.
Yet talking about Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI gets silence. Talking about Radical Islamic terrorism &amp;ndash; the biggest issue of our time &amp;ndash; gets silence.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&amp;rdquo;
 Most of you should recognize that as the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A lot of power and responsibility is recognized in that sentence.</description>

      <title>Do You Really Want Another President Clinton?</title>

      <description>Really? This #NeverTrump movement by fellow conservatives is getting out of hand. Do you realize at this point is that your only real options are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton?
Look, I get it. I&#39;m not a Trump guy myself. My first choice was Ben Carson, my second choice was Ted Cruz. They were a couple of solid conservatives who would have brought reason, common sense, and strong morals back to the White House.</description>

      <description>Over the last 10-20 years, I have had many heated political discussions with people of different colors, different backgrounds, and different walks of life. Social media has made it easier to have these discussions and meet all kinds of people. When having such discussions, my goal is to be as clear minded and rational as possible when arguing my point of view while trying to use as much anecdotal evidence as possible.</description>

      <title>Flat Tax vs. Fair Tax</title>

      <description>Republican Presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is proposing a 14.9% flat income tax and throwing out the current tax code. The primary arguments made for going to a flat tax is simple: there will be no loopholes for anyone to jump through and take advantage of, no one will be taxed twice on capital gains, interest and dividends, and most citizens will have some skin in the game.</description>

      <description>Prager University recently did a five video series on the different perspectives of the left and right on some key fundamental issues. I encourage everyone to watch the videos posted below but I&#39;ll provide a quick take on each one.
1. The Size of Government The best place to start is with this one. What is the role of government in our lives? I think the U.S. federal government has only a few rights and responsibilities.</description>

      <description>Hillary Clinton, Martin O&#39;Malley, and Bernie Sanders&amp;hellip;three people who will never be president
Disclaimer: I am NOT a Democrat. I am not endorsing any Democrats at all. I am not supporting Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O&#39;Malley and I hope the Democratic nominee gets destroyed in the general election. None of them are capable of fixing this country.
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way&amp;hellip;
Bernie Sanders is getting screwed.</description>

      <description>So a few days ago, the &amp;ldquo;Every Student Succeeds Act&amp;rdquo; was signed into law after passing the House and Senate with broad bipartisan support, a rarity in recent times. This law does away with most of the regulations that were put into place with &amp;ldquo;No Child Left Behind&amp;rdquo; and returns a lot of the power in regards to education policy back to the states. As a result, the strict pressures in testing students to receive federal funding is removed.</description>

      <title>Creating Black Conservatives</title>

      <description>Barack Obama won over 90% of the black vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In addition, Democrats routinely win at least 80% of the black vote in every election on every level. Yet black people have struggled for generations to get ahead while every other group has. This leads to an obvious question:
Why don&#39;t blacks vote conservative?
Or perhaps the real question is why do blacks not consider any republican, independent, or any third party but vote for Democrats in droves?</description>

      <description>Over two years ago, I wrote a post after an attack in London in regards to radical Islam. I called out President Obama for not calling out radical Islam. He refuses to use those words. In fact, he referred to ISIS as a JV team in 2014. Even after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015, President Obama refused to acknowledge that the real problem isn&#39;t the people, but the religion.</description>

      <description>Safe Space: A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person&#39;s self-respect and dignity and strongly encourage everyone to respect others
 WHAT??!!!!
Where did this come from and why are these popping up all over college campuses in America?</description>

      <description>I thought we were over this. I thought we learned our lesson and moved on. I thought there were more important things going on in the world that required our time attention.
I thought wrong.
Out of all of the lessons and actions that could have possibly been taken after the Charleston church shooting, Americans choose to turn their anger, not towards the person (the conservative response) or towards guns (the liberal response), but towards a flag.</description>

      <description>So a select committee has finally been formed to investigate Benghazi…20 months and one Presidential election after the attack. There are STILL questions that we are still awaiting honest answers for. I think the family members of the victims deserve answers more. In no particular order:
Why did we still have people in Benghazi after every other foreign entity, including the Red Cross, left due to safety concerns?
Why was security not increased after previous attacks on the consulate in April 2012 and on the International Red Cross office in May 2012?</description>

      <description>So mainstream media believes there is a battle on the right between Tea Party Conservatives and the establishment Republicans? They hype this disagreement and site this division as to why the Democratic Party will prevail in the 2014 elections. Their story is that the Tea Party is too “extreme” and too “radical” for mainstream Republicans and Independents to get behind. The likes of MSNBC, NBC, ABC, and CBS are saying that Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are biggest challengers on the Republican ticket for the 2016 presidential elections (Child, please!</description>

      <description>As a “black” man, I’m supposed to be obligated to comment on this case. I’m supposed to be outraged that an innocent, unarmed child carrying Skittles and iced tea was targeted and killed because of the color of his skin. I’m supposed to be outraged because this “white hispanic” wannabe cop got away with murder. I’m supposed to stand by my race. I’m supposed to believe the jury got it wrong.</description>

      <description>Let me be frank. All Americans should be against any version of amnesty. We have at least 11 million illegal immigrants here (most likely more). By any other standard, that’s an enemy invasion. A lot of these people sneaking in are low wage workers who don’t contribute anything to this country. These illegal aliens are taking jobs away that usually go to teenagers and low-skill workers. This is coming at a time when the 16-24 unemployment rate is officially at 13.</description>

      <description>So some of my friends have criticized me for being a conservative. They go on to site how much damage and suffering African-Americans have gone through because of conservatives or how conservatives are made up of rich, racist, old white men. Or they complain about conservatives clinging to their guns and Bibles and having “outdated” morals and traditions.
Nothing can be further from the truth.
I’m a conservative because I am against big government.</description>

      <description>This past week, a British solider was hacked to death by two terrorists. For more information, (VIEWERS DISCRETION ADVISED!) please check it out. This solider was hacked and stabbed to death. The two guys were shouting “Allahu Akbar!” in the process. Afterwards, these two men were allowed to walk around for at least 20 minutes before police showed up to the scene. During that time period, one of the men walked up to a camera and clearly explained his reasoning:</description>

      <description>NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY!
Let me get this straight. The City of Pittsburgh has a population of 307,000. There are 175,000 Democrats who outnumber Republicans 5 to 1. In a city that has been ran by the Democratic Party for over half a century, only 44,000 turned out. That’s 25%. Bill Peduto won the Democratic nomination with 52% of the vote. 22,800 voters is only 13% of the total number of registered Democrats.</description>
