  <p class="post-summary">Over two years ago, I wrote a post after an attack in London in regards to radical Islam. I called out President Obama for not calling out radical Islam. He refuses to use those words. In fact, he referred to ISIS as a JV team in 2014. Even after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015, President Obama refused to acknowledge that the real problem isn’t the people, but the religion.</p>

Where did this come from and why are these popping up all over college campuses in America?</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I thought we were over this. I thought we learned our lesson and moved on. I thought there were more important things going on in the world that required our time attention.
I thought wrong.
Out of all of the lessons and actions that could have possibly been taken after the Charleston church shooting, Americans choose to turn their anger, not towards the person (the conservative response) or towards guns (the liberal response), but towards a flag.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So a select committee has finally been formed to investigate Benghazi…20 months and one Presidential election after the attack. There are STILL questions that we are still awaiting honest answers for. I think the family members of the victims deserve answers more. In no particular order:
Why did we still have people in Benghazi after every other foreign entity, including the Red Cross, left due to safety concerns?
Why was security not increased after previous attacks on the consulate in April 2012 and on the International Red Cross office in May 2012?</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So mainstream media believes there is a battle on the right between Tea Party Conservatives and the establishment Republicans? They hype this disagreement and site this division as to why the Democratic Party will prevail in the 2014 elections. Their story is that the Tea Party is too “extreme” and too “radical” for mainstream Republicans and Independents to get behind. The likes of MSNBC, NBC, ABC, and CBS are saying that Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are biggest challengers on the Republican ticket for the 2016 presidential elections (Child, please!</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Let me be frank. All Americans should be against any version of amnesty. We have at least 11 million illegal immigrants here (most likely more). By any other standard, that’s an enemy invasion. A lot of these people sneaking in are low wage workers who don’t contribute anything to this country. These illegal aliens are taking jobs away that usually go to teenagers and low-skill workers. This is coming at a time when the 16-24 unemployment rate is officially at 13.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So some of my friends have criticized me for being a conservative. They go on to site how much damage and suffering African-Americans have gone through because of conservatives or how conservatives are made up of rich, racist, old white men. Or they complain about conservatives clinging to their guns and Bibles and having “outdated” morals and traditions.
Nothing can be further from the truth.
I’m a conservative because I am against big government.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">This past week, a British solider was hacked to death by two terrorists. For more information, (VIEWERS DISCRETION ADVISED!) please check it out. This solider was hacked and stabbed to death. The two guys were shouting “Allahu Akbar!” in the process. Afterwards, these two men were allowed to walk around for at least 20 minutes before police showed up to the scene. During that time period, one of the men walked up to a camera and clearly explained his reasoning:</p>
