  <p class="post-summary">Barack Obama won over 90% of the black vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In addition, Democrats routinely win at least 80% of the black vote in every election on every level. Yet black people have struggled for generations to get ahead while every other group has. This leads to an obvious question:
Why don&#39;t blacks vote conservative?
Or perhaps the real question is why do blacks not consider any republican, independent, or any third party but vote for Democrats in droves?</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Another Thanksgiving has come and gone here in America. And for another year, this great holiday where we are to be thankful for what God has provided us with has once again fallen into commercialization. Thanksgiving has devolved into the three F&#39;s:
Food, Family, and Football
People flocked to places near and far to gather together with family members (along with a few friends) to prepare and enjoy a scrumptious feast consisting of one plate (or two, three, or sometimes four) plates of food.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Over two years ago, I wrote a post after an attack in London in regards to radical Islam. I called out President Obama for not calling out radical Islam. He refuses to use those words. In fact, he referred to ISIS as a JV team in 2014. Even after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015, President Obama refused to acknowledge that the real problem isn&#39;t the people, but the religion.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Maury, Steve Wilkos, Jeremy Kyle, Trisha, Paternity Court… The list goes on. A lot of hours per day on daytime TV is spent dealing with paternity tests. Thousands of children who don&#39;t know who their father is. Thousands of women testing thousands of men so they can find their “baby&#39;s daddy”. Thousands of men who don&#39;t want to deal with “baby mama drama”. Even if the episode isn&#39;t about paternity, there are at least two “adults” involved in issues that break up relationships (if it isn&#39;t already broken) where these adults happen to have children involved.</p>

NOOOO!!!!
It&#39;s Mike Vick time in Pittsburgh.
So everybody has their concerns for one of two reasons. Either they don&#39;t think he can play anymore if he ever could play, or they harp on his past with dogfighting. If someone is worried about the Steelers and Michael Vick for football-related reasons (can&#39;t throw accurately, turns the ball over, always injured, too old, etc.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Trick or treat! Did you think I was talking about the Christmas season? Of course not! Fall is by far my favorite season of the year and it has finally come around again. The leaves falling from the trees in a variety of color, the smell of apple cider, the harvest of the fruits and vegetables, hay rides, cooler weather…AND EVERY SINGLE MAJOR SPORTS LEAGUE IN ACTION!
It&#39;s the beginning of both basketball and hockey season.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">So a couple days ago when I was about to make a post when I found that my website was compromised by Iranian hackers. My content was still there but you had to scroll halfway down the page through some obscene material. If anyone saw that, I greatly apologize. It seems as though I was hacked for a couple of weeks before I noticed. That&#39;s what happens when you don&#39;t keep up with stuff…</p>

I thought wrong.
Out of all of the lessons and actions that could have possibly been taken after the Charleston church shooting, Americans choose to turn their anger, not towards the person (the conservative response) or towards guns (the liberal response), but towards a flag.</p>
