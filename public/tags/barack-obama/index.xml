      <description>I thought &amp;ldquo;Hope and Change&amp;rdquo; was the name of the game in 2008. So why are you so resistant and allergic to change now? Is it because you don&#39;t want the changes? Maybe you don&#39;t like the changes. Was this not what you wanted?
The reality is that the United States federal government is both broke and broken. Yet anytime President Donald Trump (Still hurts, doesn&#39;t it?) proposes some kind of change to try to get our house in order, the Democrats in Congress, most leftists, and most of the mainstream media poo-poo all over it.</description>

      <description>Let me see if I got this right. If I were to ever stand with #BlackLivesMatter, I would get a ton of likes. When I post #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter, I have condemnation in a conversation thread a mile long. Talking about #PokemonGo would get me a ton of likes.
Yet talking about Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI gets silence. Talking about Radical Islamic terrorism &amp;ndash; the biggest issue of our time &amp;ndash; gets silence.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&amp;rdquo;
  1st Amendment of the United States Constitution
 That&#39;s a mouthful right there. I&#39;m not going to go into detail as to what all of this means.</description>

      <description>So a select committee has finally been formed to investigate Benghazi…20 months and one Presidential election after the attack. There are STILL questions that we are still awaiting honest answers for. I think the family members of the victims deserve answers more. In no particular order:
Why did we still have people in Benghazi after every other foreign entity, including the Red Cross, left due to safety concerns?
Why was security not increased after previous attacks on the consulate in April 2012 and on the International Red Cross office in May 2012?</description>
