      <description>Some of you are going to love this post. Most of you will hate it. My job is to ell the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts, and some of you can&#39;t handle the truth. However, the truth shall set you free. I&#39;m out of clichés.
Bernie Sanders is an admitted &amp;ldquo;democratic socialist&amp;rdquo;. There used to be a time not that long ago where socialism was proven to be a very bad thing in America and one step away from communism.</description>

      <description>Hillary Clinton, Martin O&#39;Malley, and Bernie Sanders&amp;hellip;three people who will never be president
Disclaimer: I am NOT a Democrat. I am not endorsing any Democrats at all. I am not supporting Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O&#39;Malley and I hope the Democratic nominee gets destroyed in the general election. None of them are capable of fixing this country.
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way&amp;hellip;
Bernie Sanders is getting screwed.</description>
