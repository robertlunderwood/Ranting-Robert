      <description>Trigger Warning: This post contains truthful information that may be offensive or sensitive to certain segments of the population such as college students, liberals, and blacks. I am not responsible for any hurt feelings this may cause. Of course, I don&#39;t care about your feelings.
Pittsburgh reporter Wendy Bell was [fired from WTAE] (https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2016/03/30/WTAE-TV-s-Wendy-Bell-fired-over-racially-inflammatory-messages/stories/201603300196) after making some controversial remarks on her Facebook page after a recent shooting. As we all know, when we talk about controversy and black people, it usually means black people don&#39;t like what someone else said about them because it&#39;s the truth.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t watch shows like Family Guy, The Simpsons, South Park, etc. They&#39;re usually full of trash and (mostly) liberal propaganda. However, even a blind squirrel can find a nut every once in a while. A clip from an episode of Family Guy went viral last month.

      <description>Barack Obama won over 90% of the black vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In addition, Democrats routinely win at least 80% of the black vote in every election on every level. Yet black people have struggled for generations to get ahead while every other group has. This leads to an obvious question:
Why don&#39;t blacks vote conservative?
Or perhaps the real question is why do blacks not consider any republican, independent, or any third party but vote for Democrats in droves?</description>

      <description>Safe Space: A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person&#39;s self-respect and dignity and strongly encourage everyone to respect others
 WHAT??!!!!
Where did this come from and why are these popping up all over college campuses in America?</description>

      <description>For some of you who used to follow my old rambling and rants that I posted on Myspace (yeah, I know) and Facebook from the late 2000s, you may remember how often I went off on black people. I made a promise to never again use my forum to discuss issues about the black community. It’s not that I wanted to avoid confrontation. I just got sick and tired of writing about the same old thing over and over and over and over and over and over again.</description>

      <description>So mainstream media believes there is a battle on the right between Tea Party Conservatives and the establishment Republicans? They hype this disagreement and site this division as to why the Democratic Party will prevail in the 2014 elections. Their story is that the Tea Party is too “extreme” and too “radical” for mainstream Republicans and Independents to get behind. The likes of MSNBC, NBC, ABC, and CBS are saying that Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are biggest challengers on the Republican ticket for the 2016 presidential elections (Child, please!</description>

      <description>As a “black” man, I’m supposed to be obligated to comment on this case. I’m supposed to be outraged that an innocent, unarmed child carrying Skittles and iced tea was targeted and killed because of the color of his skin. I’m supposed to be outraged because this “white hispanic” wannabe cop got away with murder. I’m supposed to stand by my race. I’m supposed to believe the jury got it wrong.</description>
