      <description>I thought &amp;ldquo;Hope and Change&amp;rdquo; was the name of the game in 2008. So why are you so resistant and allergic to change now? Is it because you don&#39;t want the changes? Maybe you don&#39;t like the changes. Was this not what you wanted?
The reality is that the United States federal government is both broke and broken. Yet anytime President Donald Trump (Still hurts, doesn&#39;t it?) proposes some kind of change to try to get our house in order, the Democrats in Congress, most leftists, and most of the mainstream media poo-poo all over it.</description>
