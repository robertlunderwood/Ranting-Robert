      <description>Over the last 10-20 years, I have had many heated political discussions with people of different colors, different backgrounds, and different walks of life. Social media has made it easier to have these discussions and meet all kinds of people. When having such discussions, my goal is to be as clear minded and rational as possible when arguing my point of view while trying to use as much anecdotal evidence as possible.</description>

      <description>Prager University recently did a five video series on the different perspectives of the left and right on some key fundamental issues. I encourage everyone to watch the videos posted below but I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a quick take on each one.
1. The Size of Government  The best place to start is with this one. What is the role of government in our lives? I think the U.S. federal government has only a few rights and responsibilities.</description>

      <title>Creating Black Conservatives</title>

      <description>Barack Obama won over 90% of the black vote in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In addition, Democrats routinely win at least 80% of the black vote in every election on every level. Yet black people have struggled for generations to get ahead while every other group has. This leads to an obvious question:
Why don&amp;rsquo;t blacks vote conservative?
Or perhaps the real question is why do blacks not consider any republican, independent, or any third party but vote for Democrats in droves?</description>

      <description>Note: This is NOT an endorsement on the comments made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling.
So Clippers owner Donald Sterling was fined $2.5 million and banned from the NBA for life. There wasn’t even as much as a hint of an investigation before this was handed down. What did he do to warrant this harsh punishment? Did he beat his wife? Did he kill someone? Is he a serial rapist?</description>

      <description>So mainstream media believes there is a battle on the right between Tea Party Conservatives and the establishment Republicans? They hype this disagreement and site this division as to why the Democratic Party will prevail in the 2014 elections. Their story is that the Tea Party is too “extreme” and too “radical” for mainstream Republicans and Independents to get behind. The likes of MSNBC, NBC, ABC, and CBS are saying that Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are biggest challengers on the Republican ticket for the 2016 presidential elections (Child, please!</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m a Conservative</title>

      <description>So some of my friends have criticized me for being a conservative. They go on to site how much damage and suffering African-Americans have gone through because of conservatives or how conservatives are made up of rich, racist, old white men. Or they complain about conservatives clinging to their guns and Bibles and having “outdated” morals and traditions.
Nothing can be further from the truth.
I’m a conservative because I am against big government.</description>
