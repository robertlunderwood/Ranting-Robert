      <description>I thought &amp;ldquo;Hope and Change&amp;rdquo; was the name of the game in 2008. So why are you so resistant and allergic to change now? Is it because you don&amp;rsquo;t want the changes? Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t like the changes. Was this not what you wanted?
The reality is that the United States federal government is both broke and broken. Yet anytime President Donald Trump (Still hurts, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?) proposes some kind of change to try to get our house in order, the Democrats in Congress, most leftists, and most of the mainstream media poo-poo all over it.</description>

      <description>Republican Presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is proposing a 14.9% flat income tax and throwing out the current tax code. The primary arguments made for going to a flat tax is simple: there will be no loopholes for anyone to jump through and take advantage of, no one will be taxed twice on capital gains, interest and dividends, and most citizens will have some skin in the game.</description>
