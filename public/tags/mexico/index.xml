      <description>Let me be frank. All Americans should be against any version of amnesty. We have at least 11 million illegal immigrants here (most likely more). By any other standard, that’s an enemy invasion. A lot of these people sneaking in are low wage workers who don’t contribute anything to this country. These illegal aliens are taking jobs away that usually go to teenagers and low-skill workers. This is coming at a time when the 16-24 unemployment rate is officially at 13.</description>
