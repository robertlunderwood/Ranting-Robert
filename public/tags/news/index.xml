      <description>Trigger Warning: This post contains truthful information that may be offensive or sensitive to certain segments of the population such as college students, liberals, and blacks. I am not responsible for any hurt feelings this may cause. Of course, I don&#39;t care about your feelings.
Pittsburgh reporter Wendy Bell was [fired from WTAE] (https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2016/03/30/WTAE-TV-s-Wendy-Bell-fired-over-racially-inflammatory-messages/stories/201603300196) after making some controversial remarks on her Facebook page after a recent shooting. As we all know, when we talk about controversy and black people, it usually means black people don&#39;t like what someone else said about them because it&#39;s the truth.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t watch shows like Family Guy, The Simpsons, South Park, etc. They&#39;re usually full of trash and (mostly) liberal propaganda. However, even a blind squirrel can find a nut every once in a while. A clip from an episode of Family Guy went viral last month.
 Peter Griffin: Everyone! Everyone! Listen, I have something to say. Cleveland Jr. Doesn&#39;t deserve any of this. All those things you heard about Cleveland Jr.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&amp;rdquo;
  1st Amendment of the United States Constitution
 That&#39;s a mouthful right there. I&#39;m not going to go into detail as to what all of this means.</description>
