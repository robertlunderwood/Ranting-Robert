      <description>Maury, Steve Wilkos, Jeremy Kyle, Trisha, Paternity Court&amp;hellip; The list goes on. A lot of hours per day on daytime TV is spent dealing with paternity tests. Thousands of children who don&#39;t know who their father is. Thousands of women testing thousands of men so they can find their &amp;ldquo;baby&#39;s daddy&amp;rdquo;. Thousands of men who don&#39;t want to deal with &amp;ldquo;baby mama drama&amp;rdquo;. Even if the episode isn&#39;t about paternity, there are at least two &amp;ldquo;adults&amp;rdquo; involved in issues that break up relationships (if it isn&#39;t already broken) where these adults happen to have children involved.</description>
