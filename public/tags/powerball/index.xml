      <description>In case you&#39;ve missed the news, the Powerball jackpot is now up to $1.5 billion. That&#39;s BILLION with a B.
$1,500,000,000.
Yowzer!!! That&#39;s a lot of money. Life altering money. And yet, it won&#39;t change a thing. Every single one of you reading this who decides to play won&#39;t win. I can safely say that given that the odds of winning are 1 in 292 million. For whoever does win, problems will come with it.</description>
