      <description>For those of you that have been living under a rock, the FBI and Apple have been engaged in a legal battle over unlocking the iPhone of the terrorist in the San Bernadino attack. The FBI wants to get into the phone to further investigate the attack, having already previously obtained a warrant. However, they cannot get into the phone since there is a pass code. It&#39;s a newer model phone with built-in encryption and investigators are worried the data would be wiped if they tried to get access to the phone by brute force&amp;ndash;10,000 combinations and the phone will probably wipe itself after 10 tries.</description>
