      <description>Let me see if I got this right. If I were to ever stand with #BlackLivesMatter, I would get a ton of likes. When I post #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter, I have condemnation in a conversation thread a mile long. Talking about #PokemonGo would get me a ton of likes.
Yet talking about Hillary Clinton lying to the FBI gets silence. Talking about Radical Islamic terrorism &amp;ndash; the biggest issue of our time &amp;ndash; gets silence.</description>

      <description>For those of you that have been living under a rock, the FBI and Apple have been engaged in a legal battle over unlocking the iPhone of the terrorist in the San Bernadino attack. The FBI wants to get into the phone to further investigate the attack, having already previously obtained a warrant. However, they cannot get into the phone since there is a pass code. It&#39;s a newer model phone with built-in encryption and investigators are worried the data would be wiped if they tried to get access to the phone by brute force&amp;ndash;10,000 combinations and the phone will probably wipe itself after 10 tries.</description>

      <description>Over two years ago, I wrote a post after an attack in London in regards to radical Islam. I called out President Obama for not calling out radical Islam. He refuses to use those words. In fact, he referred to ISIS as a JV team in 2014. Even after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015, President Obama refused to acknowledge that the real problem isn&#39;t the people, but the religion.</description>

      <description>So a select committee has finally been formed to investigate Benghazi…20 months and one Presidential election after the attack. There are STILL questions that we are still awaiting honest answers for. I think the family members of the victims deserve answers more. In no particular order:
Why did we still have people in Benghazi after every other foreign entity, including the Red Cross, left due to safety concerns?
Why was security not increased after previous attacks on the consulate in April 2012 and on the International Red Cross office in May 2012?</description>

      <description>This past week, a British solider was hacked to death by two terrorists. For more information, (VIEWERS DISCRETION ADVISED!) please check it out. This solider was hacked and stabbed to death. The two guys were shouting “Allahu Akbar!” in the process. Afterwards, these two men were allowed to walk around for at least 20 minutes before police showed up to the scene. During that time period, one of the men walked up to a camera and clearly explained his reasoning:</description>
