      <description>As a “black” man, I’m supposed to be obligated to comment on this case. I’m supposed to be outraged that an innocent, unarmed child carrying Skittles and iced tea was targeted and killed because of the color of his skin. I’m supposed to be outraged because this “white hispanic” wannabe cop got away with murder. I’m supposed to stand by my race. I’m supposed to believe the jury got it wrong.</description>
